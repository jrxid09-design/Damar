 * DAMAR MANAGER — CANONICAL TRUSTED BOOTSTRAP (Lane 5).
 *
 * This is the ONLY place where the canonical application Manager instance is
 * created. It is NOT a public/downstream API surface beyond the frozen facade
 * it returns.
 *
 * CORE LAWS:
 *
 *   MANAGER != AUTHORITY
 *   FACTORY AVAILABLE != CANONICAL APPLICATION MANAGER INSTANCE
 *   FIRST COMPOSITION CREATION DOES NOT ESTABLISH SHARED TRUST
 *
 * The production canonical Manager is created by createDamarManager() which
 * takes NO options: the Lane 2/Lane 3/Lane 4 facades are the canonical
 * bootstrap-owned singletons, and NO test channel adapters are wired. The
 * canonical authentication path is fail-closed (the Lane 2 bootstrap's fixed
 * adapter) until a later lane wires real trusted auth infrastructure INTO the
 * bootstrap — the Manager can therefore never mint a principal that trusted
 * infrastructure did not establish.
 *
 * The production facade is EXACTLY:
 *
 *     Object.freeze({ handle, cancel,
 *                     isCanonicalManagerRequest, isCanonicalManagerResult })
 *
 * It MUST NOT and DOES NOT expose: the Lane 2/Lane 3/Lane 4 facades, the
 * planner, the verifier/actuator registries, the capability registrar, any
 * brand state, any composition factory, or any channel authority hook.
