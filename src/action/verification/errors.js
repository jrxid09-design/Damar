/**
 * ACTION VERIFICATION + COMPENSATION V1 — Lane 4 error + state contract
 * (inert vocabulary ONLY — no builder, no registry, no factory, no brand).
 *
 * CORE LAWS (Lane 4 — extends the certified Lane 1–3 chain):
 *
 *   EXECUTED != VERIFIED
 *   ACTUATOR REPORT != WORLD TRUTH
 *   TIMEOUT != NO SIDE EFFECT
 *   AUDIT != CURRENT TRUTH
 *   MEMORY != CURRENT TRUTH
 *   MODEL CLAIM != VERIFICATION
 *   PLAN != AUTHORITY
 *   COMPENSATION != ROLLBACK GUARANTEE
 *
 * Every rejection carries a stable `reasonCode` so callers branch on
 * machine-readable causes without parsing messages. All failures are
 * fail-closed: malformed input is rejected, never silently repaired.
 *
 * TRUST ORIGIN (mirrors Lane 2/Lane 3 certified discipline):
 *
 *   - Verifier and compensator registration is BOOTSTRAP-OWNED. The registry
 *     implementation, registrar capability, brand tokens, brand WeakSets and
 *     every privileged former live ONLY inside the trusted bootstrap's private
 *     composition closure (src/action/bootstrap.js). A direct import of THIS
 *     module yields ONLY the inert vocabularies below — no constructor, no
 *     registrar, no factory, no mutation surface.
 *
 *   - The result-provenance predicates (isCanonicalVerificationRequest /
 *     isCanonicalVerificationResult / isCanonicalCompensationPlan) are
 *     BRAND-FIRST: they read closure-private WeakSets owned by the trusted
 *     bootstrap and live as METHODS on the canonical verification facade.
 *     There is no free function here that could recognize them structurally.
 *
 *   - Downstream may supply DECLARATIVE expected postconditions (canonical
 *     declarative spec values) — never executable predicate code, never a
 *     caller-selected verifier/sensor/predicate/compensator.
 *
 * THE PUBLIC/DOWNSTREAM SURFACE IS EXACTLY the frozen
 * { verify, compensate } (+ pure brand-recognition predicates) handed out by
 * createCanonicalVerificationFacade() — see the Lane 4 doc:
 * docs/architecture/ACTION-VERIFICATION-COMPENSATION-V1.md
